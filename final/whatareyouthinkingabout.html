if you were to see me here, sitting<br>on the toilet– hunched over<br>from my monthly cramping,<br>book and pencil in hand, jeans<br>at my knees–<br>what would you really see?
<br><br>would you look<br>away from the
<br><br>intimacy?     would you grimace
<br>at my posture?
<br><br>would you take in<br>the way my hair falls<br>off my shoulder and<br>take a moment,<br>submit?
