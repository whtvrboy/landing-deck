In her mom’s car<br>heading north<br>on a Friday,
<br><br>watching the blue-tinted cotton<br>drift beyond the sky,<br>seeing evidence of its heavier sister<br>sweeping rain over the holdings,<br>pierced by the sun above.
<br><br>Spots bamboo seized<br>from the farmer,<br>and my old backyard–<br>Which the construction crew<br>and my uncle<br>didn't bother cleaning<br>before abandoning.
<br><br>The mole<br>on the side<br>of her right pointer finger<br>as she lets<br>wind play<br>with her own hand.
