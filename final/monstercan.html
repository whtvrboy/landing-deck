The empty Monster can<br>On the floorboard of your Jeep.<br>I tuck it behind my heels<br>So it doesn’t roll around and bump into my feet.
<br><br>Speeding over the hills,<br>The bends of Charlottesville.<br>Normally I’d look at the road out of fear,<br>Instead I just keep looking at you.<br>Thought you kept stealing glances at me.<br>Now I remember,<br>The sideview mirror.
