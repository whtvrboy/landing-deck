I still wonder
<br>what happened-
<br>what exactly
<br>changed
<div class="daffodil">for you?</div>

<br>Did you catch
<br>me in the wrong
<div class="light">light? Did you</div>
finally see
<br>the distance
<div class="road">between</div>
our differences?

<br><br>If I had
<div class="differences">hidden at all,</div>
waited to
<br>reveal myselfâ€“
<br>would you
<br>have found it
<br>all small?

<br><br>Or worse,
<br>did it
<br>have nothing
<div class="moonflower">to do with me?</div>
Did you really
<br>lack the ability
<br>to know
<br>none of our
<br>happiness
<br>was what
<br>you could handle?
